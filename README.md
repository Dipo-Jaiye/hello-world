This is an introductory git task
Hello everyone, this is the tutorial from git, so I'm using it to get familiar with using Git.
I code in Python mostly, I know some HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript. I also have history with C++.
However, I do not know how to use frameworks yet or what they are, so when people say stuff like Django or NodeJs, I'm always lost.
